ok so first things first thank you for making me world chef, i always knew my cooking would be good someday, so anyways. im going to show you how to make Sinistxr's Fried rice, first youll need Basmati rice, chicken broth, and the holy grail (dont forget veggies)
So first thing you wanna do is go to your rice and open it up, pour 1/2 a cup of it into the grail, then put some water in, measure it with your finger, it needs to reach the first line on your finger, then put some chicken broth in, then i want you to start running to bardsey island, then once you reach there, turn on an oven on the island, now i want you to start cooking the rice normally, but be fast or else the grail will zap you, if it does, its over, so as you do that the ground might shake, this is normal, and the world might beign to psin, but i dont care what you do, you DO NOT STOP, after around 1 hour your hand might get tired of stirring, keep going, this is good, once youve reached the 1 hour and a half mark, take the grail and get out of there as fast as you can, once you do so, hea dback home, the grail will have cooked the rice, then cut up some veggies, put them in, and it will be set!
